        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">With Vijay Mallya facing financial and legal troubles, the Force India F1 team was put into administration during the 2018 season in August. Force India's assets were purchased by <b>Racing Point</b> UK. However, the team's official F1 entry was not transferable, thereby marking the official end of the entry originating in 1991. The team was renamed <b>Racing Point</b> Force India for the remainder of the 2018 season before becoming Racing Point the next season.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Canadian businessman Lawrence Stroll led a consortium to become the new Force India owner. Stroll reportedly invested a whopping £182 million into the British automobile brand. With Stroll effecting becoming the team's new owner, his son Lance Stroll got the <b>Racing Point</b> seat, beginning from the 2019 season as he replaced Esteban Ocon.</p>

          <br class="hidden lg:inline-block">
        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Formula 1 was brought to India in year 2011. It seemed quiet a success as it drew fans in large numbers (around 95000). The Budh international circuit is the race track where F1 races were held. The circuit is owned by Jaypee group. Many drivers liked the experience of driving at the venue. Twice world champion Fernando Alonso also said that it's one of the fastest circuit in F1 calendar.

            By the year 2013 however the number of tickets that were sold for the event decreased drastically(less than 60000).</p>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Most important reason why Formula 1 withdrew from India was that the race authority of India failed to pay the hosting fee to F1. This led to a dispute between the two managements. The council Jaypee sports international has yet to pay F1 organizers almost 50 millions US dollars. F1 managements considered there is no longer any profit by hosting F1 event in India. Moreover by the new law enforcement by Supreme Court of India the races held between 2011 to 2013 are taxable and F1 has to pay 40 % tax to Indian government.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Will F1 come to India again ? The chance are very minimal. You see, the owner of the track JK Cement took sack loads of loans to build and maintain the track. They even took a loan to host the race. And as fate had it, the company ran into loss the same year so they were unable to pay back their loans so FIA, seeing this, revoked their 3 year contract and removed India from the F1 calendar. I do really hope something happens and F1 returns to India.</p>
